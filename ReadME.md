# Systems of Equations in Python: A Beginner’s Guide ENGR 107 - SWE Workshop

Welcome to the **Systems of Equations Workshop**! In this workshop, we’ll learn how Python can solve systems of equations — and yes, even calculate how many kombuchas and cappuccinos you ordered. (Because who doesn’t need to know the precise extent of their caffeine addiction?) 

---

## What’s Happening?

- **Setting up the equations:** We write our equations as a matrix to keep things tidy.
- **Python in action:** Python crunches the numbers and tells us exactly how many kombuchas and cappuccinos were ordered.
- **The big reveal:** We now know exactly how bad our caffeine addiction is.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into coding, let's make sure you have everything you need.

### 1. **Downloading Python**

Python is the language we’re using, and here’s how you get it installed on your system:

#### **For Windows:**
- **Step 1:** Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Step 2:** Download the latest Windows installer.
- **Step 3:** Run the installer and **check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"**.
- **Step 4:** Follow the installation steps.

#### **For Mac:**
- **Step 1:** Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Step 2:** Download the latest macOS installer.
- **Step 3:** Open the downloaded package and follow the prompts.
- **Step 4:** Alternatively, you can install Python via Homebrew (see below).

#### **For Linux:**
- **Step 1:** Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. Check by opening a terminal and typing:
  ```bash
  python3 --version

- **Step 2:** If it’s not installed, use your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3
  ```
- **Step 3:** For Fedora:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3
  ```

### 2. **Installing Homebrew (Mac Only) // IF HOMEBREW NOT INSTALLED**

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes installing software (like Python) a breeze. If you’d prefer to use Homebrew to install Python or other tools, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Terminal** application.
- **Step 2:** Paste the following command and press **Enter**:
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
- **Step 3:** Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
- **Step 4:** Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Python by typing:
  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```

### 3. **Choosing an IDE or Text Editor**

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor makes coding easier. Here are some options:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
  - Free and beginner-friendly.
  - Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - Great for Python with the official Python extension.

- **PyCharm:**
  - Available as a free Community Edition.
  - Download from [jetbrains.com/pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

- **Thonny:**
  - Designed specifically for beginners.
  - Download from [thonny.org](https://thonny.org/).

- **Vim:**
  - A powerful text editor if you’re feeling adventurous.
  - **Quick Vim Tutorial:**
    - **Open a file:** In your terminal, type:
      ```bash
      vim your_script.py
      ```
    - **Insert mode:** Press `i` to start editing.
    - **Save and exit:** Press `Esc`, type `:wq`, then hit `Enter`.
    - **For help:** Inside Vim, type `:help` for more commands.
  - **Note:** Vim has a steep learning curve, but it’s useful once you get the hang of it!

### 4. **Running Your Python Code**

Once you’ve written your code (whether in VS Code, PyCharm, Thonny, or Vim), you can run it from your terminal or command prompt.

- **Open your terminal/command prompt.**
- **Navigate to your script’s directory:**
  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/script
  ```
- **Run the script:**
  ```bash
  python your_script.py
  ```
  or on some systems:
  ```bash
  python3 your_script.py
  ```

## Final Thoughts

This guide is designed to get you started on your Python journey in a fun, friendly way. Don’t worry if you’re new to programming – everyone starts somewhere. Grab your favorite IDE (or even Vim if you’re feeling bold), install Python (and Homebrew if you’re on a Mac), and dive into the code. Let’s discover the magic of solving systems of equations together!

Happy coding, and may your kombucha and cappuccino calculations always be precise!
